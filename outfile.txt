This is image is "Saturn's North Polar Hexagon" by No photographer found.. In full view, the amazing six-sided jet stream known as Saturn's north polar hexagon is shown in this colorful Cassini image. Extending to 70 degrees north latitude, the false-color video frame is map-projected, based on infrared, visible, and ultraviolet image data recorded by the Saturn-orbiting spacecraft in late 2012. First found in the outbound Voyager flyby images from the 1980s, the bizarre, long-lived feature tied to the planet's rotation is about 30,000 kilometers across. At its center lies the ringed gas giant's hurricane-like north polar storm. A new long term study of Cassini data has found a remarkable higher-altitude vortex, exactly matching the outlines of the north polar hexagon, that formed as summer approached the planet's northern hemisphere. It appears to reach hundreds of kilometers above these deeper cloud tops, into Saturn's stratosphere.This is image is "Comet Leonard Before Star Cluster M3" by Dan Bartlett.
Comet Leonard is now visible to the unaided eye -- but just barely.  Passing nearest to the Earth today, the comet is best seen this week soon after sunset, toward the west, low on the horizon.  Currently best visible in the north, by late December the comet will best be seen from south of Earth's equator. The featured image of Comet C/2021 A1 (Leonard) was taken a week ago from California, USA. The deep exposure shows in great detail the comet's green gas coma and developing dust tail. The comet -- across our inner Solar System and only light-minutes away -- was captured passing nearly in front of globular star cluster M3. In contrast, M3 is about 35,000 light-years away.  In a week, Comet Leonard will pass unusually close to Venus, but will continue on and be at its closest to the Sun in early January.This is image is "Comet Leonard Before Star Cluster M3" by Dan Bartlett.
